## Phase shifts
Other than kernel functions of the KT equations, which are fixed for a given $J^{PC}$ of the decay, the phase shifts $\delta_i(s)$ are required as inputs. 

So far, we have only considered $3\pi$ decays and thus only require the elastic $\pi\pi$ phase shifts. Here we provide a collection of phases from various groups for systematics studies:
- `madrid/` contains phases from [10.1103/PhysRevD.83.074004](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.83.074004). 
- `orsay/` from [10.1140/epjc/s10052-024-13084-y](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-024-13084-y).
- `bern/` from [10.1140/epjc/s10052-012-1860-1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-012-1860-1).
